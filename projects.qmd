### Vancouver Trees Dashboard (2025)

A side project, just for fun! <img src="/vancouvertrees/favicon.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.25em; margin-left: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.1em;">

This web app lets you explore all public trees in Vancouver, BC. Includes an interactive map, Google Street View integration, a table for exploring species, and a heatmap for exploring tree height by neighbourhood.

### Automated Medical Image Segmentation for Precision Orthopedic Surgery (2025)

Capstone project for my [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/){target="_blank"} at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.

This project was a collaboration with the [Digital Lab at the BC Children's Hospital](https://www.digitallab.org/){target="_blank"}. Our team developed a dashboard and end-to-end machine learning pipeline to automatically segment bones from CT scan imagery and export these models for 3D printing. This end-to-end pipeline will allow clinical engineers and orthopedic surgeons to more quickly and accurately plan procedures, increasing caseload capacity and reducing patient wait times.

Technologies used:

- [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet){target="_blank"} neural network architecture
- [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/){target="_blank"}
- [Python](https://www.python.org/){target="_blank"}

### Patient Validation of a Motor Imagery-based Neurofeedback Paradigm (2017)

Undergraduate Honours Project for my [B.Sc. in Neuroscience](https://www.dal.ca/study/programs/undergraduate/neuroscience-bsc-ba.html) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS.

Designed and implemented digital signal processing and analysis pipelines for high-resolution MEG data to evaluate a motor imagery‚Äìbased neurofeedback paradigm in stroke patients. Developed preprocessing, artifact rejection, and source localization workflows in Python to detect and quantify beta-band activity in sensorimotor cortex, producing visualizations and laterality metrics to compare patient and control data.

Technologies used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/){target="_blank"}
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/){target="_blank"}
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/){target="_blank"}
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/){target="_blank"}

### Android App for EEG-based Neurofeedback in Stroke Recovery (2015)

Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (RADIANT Program), IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS.

Collected and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data for a project investigating neurofeedback in motor imagery therapy, supporting the development of a brain-computer interface for stroke recovery.

Developed and tested a mobile application that implemented the project‚Äôs digital signal processing algorithms for live EEG data, providing a mobile platform for neurofeedback-assisted motor imagery therapy.

Technologies used:
