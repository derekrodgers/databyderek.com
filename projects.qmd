### Vancouver Trees Dashboard (2025)

A side project, for fun! <img src="/vancouvertrees/favicon.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.25em; margin-left: 0.25em; margin-bottom: 0.1em;">

A web app for exploring public trees in Vancouver. Features an interactive map, Street View integration, a table for searching and sorting species, and a heatmap of tree height by neighbourhood.

### Automated Medical Image Segmentation for Precision Orthopedic Surgery (2025)

Capstone project for my [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/){target="_blank"} at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/){target="_blank"}. A collaboration with the [Digital Lab](https://www.digitallab.org/){target="_blank"} at the [BC Children's Hospital](https://www.bcchildrens.ca/){target="_blank"}.

Our team developed a web dashboard and machine learning pipeline to automatically segment bones from patient CT scans and export these for 3D printing. This end-to-end solution will allow the hospital's clinical engineers and orthopedic surgeons to more quickly and accurately plan orthopedic surgeries, increasing caseload capacity and reducing patient wait times.

### Patient Validation of a Motor Imagery-based Neurofeedback Paradigm (2017)

Undergraduate Honours Project for my [B.Sc. in Neuroscience](https://www.dal.ca/study/programs/undergraduate/neuroscience-bsc-ba.html){target="_blank"} at [Dalhousie](https://www.dal.ca/){target="_blank"}.

Designed and implemented digital signal processing and analysis pipelines for [MEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography){target="_blank"} data to evaluate a [motor imagery‚Äìbased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_imagery){target="_blank"} [neurofeedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback){target="_blank"} paradigm in stroke patients. Developed preprocessing, artifact rejection, and source localization workflows in Python, supporting further clinical work in patients with stroke-related upper limb dysfunction.

### Android App for EEG-based Neurofeedback in Stroke Recovery (2015)

Undergraduate Research Fellowship during my [B.Sc. in Neuroscience](https://www.dal.ca/study/programs/undergraduate/neuroscience-bsc-ba.html){target="_blank"} at [Dalhousie](https://www.dal.ca/){target="_blank"}. A collaboration with the [IWK Health Centre](https://iwkhealth.ca/){target="_blank"}.

Ported the lab's digital signal processing algorithims for live [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography){target="_blank"} data from MATLAB to Java. Developed an Android app for live, EEG-based neurofeedback during motor imagery, providing a proof-of-concept for at-home neurofeedback therapy.
