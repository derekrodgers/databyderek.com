Hi, I'm Derek!

I'm a data scientist with more than six years of analytics experience across multiple domains.

I love solving complex problems, especially wrangling, analyzing, interactively exploring, and interpreting data.

Most recently, I was creating [interactive dashboards](https://www.salussafety.io/reporting){target="_blank"} for the construction industry. In 2025, I graduated from the [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/){target="_blank"} program at the University of British Columbia.
