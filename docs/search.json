Includes an interactive map, Google Street View integration, a table for exploring species, and a heatmap for exploring tree height by neighbourhood.\n\nüåê Live app\nGitHub Repository\n\nTechnologies used:\n\nR Shiny\nCustom JavaScript\n\n\n\nAutomated Medical Image Segmentation for Precision Orthopedic Surgery (2025)\nCapstone project for my Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.\nThis project was a collaboration with the Digital Lab at the BC Children‚Äôs Hospital. Our team developed a dashboard and end-to-end machine learning pipeline to automatically segment bones from CT scan imagery and export these models for 3D printing. This end-to-end pipeline will allow clinical engineers and orthopedic surgeons to more quickly and accurately plan procedures, increasing caseload capacity and reducing patient wait times.\nTechnologies used:\n\nnnU-Net neural network architecture\nPlotly Dash\nPython\nDocker\n\n\n\nPatient Validation of a Motor Imagery-based Neurofeedback Paradigm (2017)\nUndergraduate Honours Project for my B.Sc. in Neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS.\nDesigned and implemented digital signal processing and analysis pipelines for high-resolution MEG data to evaluate a motor imagery‚Äìbased neurofeedback paradigm in stroke patients. Developed preprocessing, artifact rejection, and source localization workflows in Python to detect and quantify beta-band activity in sensorimotor cortex, producing visualizations and laterality metrics to compare patient and control data.\nTechnologies used:\n\nPython\nNumPy\nSciPy\nMatplotlib\n\n\n\nAndroid App for EEG-based Neurofeedback in Stroke Recovery (2015)\nSummer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (RADIANT Program), IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS.\nCollected and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data for a project investigating neurofeedback in motor imagery therapy, supporting the development of a brain-computer interface for stroke recovery.\nDeveloped and tested a mobile application that implemented the project‚Äôs digital signal processing algorithms for live EEG data, providing a mobile platform for neurofeedback-assisted motor imagery therapy.\nTechnologies used:\n\nMATLAB\nJava\nAndroid Studio\nAndroid SDK"
