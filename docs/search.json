    "text": "Vancouver Trees Dashboard (2025)\nA side project, for fun \nA web app for exploring public trees in Vancouver. Features an interactive map, Street View integration, a table for searching and sorting species, and a heatmap of tree height by neighbourhood.\n\n🌐 Live app\n\nTechnologies used:\n\nR\nShiny (web dashboard framework)\nDocker\n\n\n\nAutomated Medical Image Segmentation for Precision Orthopedic Surgery (2025)\nCapstone project for my Master of Data Science at UBC. A collaboration with the Digital Lab at the BC Children’s Hospital.\nOur team developed a web dashboard and machine learning pipeline to automatically segment bones from patient CT scans and export these for 3D printing. This end-to-end solution will allow the hospital’s clinical engineers and orthopedic surgeons to more quickly and accurately plan orthopedic surgeries, increasing caseload capacity and reducing patient wait times.\nTechnologies used:\n\nPython\nPandas\nNumPy\nnnU-Net\nPlotly Dash\nDocker\n\n\n\nPatient Validation of a Motor Imagery-based Neurofeedback Paradigm (2017)\nUndergraduate Honours Project for my B.Sc. in Neuroscience at Dalhousie.\nDesigned and implemented digital signal processing and analysis pipelines for MEG data to evaluate a motor imagery–based neurofeedback paradigm in stroke patients. Developed preprocessing, artifact rejection, and source localization workflows in Python, supporting further clinical work in patients with stroke-related upper limb dysfunction.\nTechnologies used:\n\nPython\nNumPy\nSciPy\nMatplotlib\n\n\n\nAndroid App for EEG-based Neurofeedback in Stroke Recovery (2015)\nUndergraduate Research Fellowship during my B.Sc. in Neuroscience at Dalhousie. A collaboration with the IWK Health Centre.\nPorted the lab’s digital signal processing algorithims for live EEG data from MATLAB to Java. Developed an Android app for live, EEG-based neurofeedback during motor imagery, providing a proof-of-concept for at-home neurofeedback therapy.\nTechnologies used:\n\nMATLAB\nJava\nAndroid Studio\nAndroid SDK"
